# **Changes and Improvements in Link Prediction Implementation**

This README highlights the changes and improvements made in the second version of the Link Prediction notebook compared to the first version.

---

## **Key Improvements**

### **1. Installation and Setup**
- Added explicit code to install PyTorch Geometric and its dependencies. This ensures seamless setup and reproducibility.

### **2. Random Seed Initialization**
- Introduced random seed initialization for consistent results across runs, ensuring reproducible training and evaluation outcomes.

### **3. Advanced Model Architectures**
- Added implementations for three state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures:
  - **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN):** Captures local neighborhood structure through spectral convolutions.
  - **GraphSAGE:** Provides inductive learning with various aggregation strategies like mean and max pooling.
  - **Graph Attention Networks (GAT):** Uses multi-head attention to dynamically assign importance to neighbors.

### **4. Link Prediction Framework**
- Unified the link prediction task under a modular **`LinkPredictor`** class that integrates GNN encoders and a dot-product decoder.

### **5. Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Added a grid search for hyperparameter tuning:
  - Learning rates: [0.01, 0.005, 0.001].
  - Hidden dimensions: [32, 64, 128].
  - Number of layers: [2, 3].
- Tracked and saved the best-performing model based on validation AUC.

### **6. Enhanced Training and Evaluation**
- Modularized the training and testing pipeline for better scalability and readability.
- Introduced detailed logging of metrics (AUC and AP) for validation and testing.

### **7. Multi-Model Comparisons**
- Extended the framework to compare multiple architectures (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT) within a single pipeline.

### **8. Visualization**
- Added visualization of the top predicted links on the graph, highlighting them in red for better interpretability.

### **9. Model Saving**
- Introduced functionality to save the best-performing model as a `.pth` file for future use.
